## Introduction
ReactiveX is a library for creating asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences. This approach is similar to how ReactiveUI handles updating the view as the user triggers events. ReactiveUI provides additional features tailored specifically for creating an application with a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. Nevertheless, ReactiveX and ReactiveUI share many similarities and differences between their observables and schedulers. These modules are the driving force behind reactive programming, and ReactiveX and ReactiveUI would not function without them.
